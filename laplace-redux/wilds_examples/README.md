These examples are simply copied from https://github.com/p-lambda/wilds in version `1.1.0` and the examples folder was renamed to wilds_experiments.

Further, all relative imports where it was necessary were corrected by prepending `wilds_examples.`, e.g.

        from configs.model import model_defaults

to 

        from wilds_examples.configs.model import model_defaults
